	 * ## Critical data loss prevention mechanism
	 *
	 * The `slugsSeenSoFar` array is necessary to keep the Playground sites running
	 * without being implicitly destroyed by React.
	 *
	 * ## The problem
	 *
	 * When an iframe is moved around in the DOM, its internal state is reset
	 * and the Playground site is lost. Unfortunately, React liberally moves
	 * DOM nodes around even when the `key` prop is set.
	 *
	 * Imagine we're rendering five site viewports, and a sixth site viewport is
	 * added at the beginning of the list in the next render.
	 *
	 * The only way to preserve the state the existing viewports, is to create a new
	 * DOM node for the sixth site viewport and insert it before the already existing
	 * viewports without moving any of the iframes or their parent nodes. Unfortunately,
	 * that's not what React does.
	 *
	 * I don't know exactly which DOM operations React performs, but the existing
	 * iframes are moved around and the Playground sites inside them are trashed
	 * in the process.
	 *
	 * ## The solution
	 *
	 * We never trash, reorder, or remove any DOM nodes.
	 *
	 * This append-only list of slugs is used to keep track of all the sites this
	 * component was ever asked to render. Every site stays in its own div, always
	 * at the same index in the DOM. Every new site is appended to the end of the list,
	 * never in the middle. When a site is deleted, we keep the top-level wrapper div
	 * and only remove the iframe inside it.
	 *
	 * This way, React never reassigns which div is which site and never moves our
	 * precious iframes around.
	 *
	 * The cost is that we render more and more divs over time. That's not a problem.
	 * We're talking about maybe a 100 empty divs in an extreme scenario. That's nothing.
