/**
 * Playground's service worker. Here's a rundown of non-obvious things that
 * are happening in here:
 *
 * ## Playground must be upgraded as early as possible after a new release
 *
 * New service workers call .skipWaiting(), immediately claim all the clients
 * that were controlled by the previous service worker, and forcibly refreshes
 * them.
 *
 * Why?
 *
 * Because Playground fetches new resources asynchronously and on demand. However,
 * deploying a new webapp version of the app destroys the resources referenced in
 * the previous webapp version. Therefore, we can't allow the previous version
 * to run when a new version becomes available.
 *
 * ## Caching strategy
 *
 * Playground uses caching heavily to achieve great loading speeds and provide
 * an offline mode.
 *
 * Caching is a complex beast. Playground deals with the following cache layers:
 *
 * * HTTP cache in the browser
 * * CacheStorage in the service worker
 * * Edge Cache on playground.wordpress.net
 *
 * ### HTTP cache in the browser
 *
 * This service worker skips the browser HTTP cache for all network requests. This is because
 * the HTTP cache caused a particularly nasty problem in Playground deployments.
 *
 * Installing a new service worker purged the CacheStorage and requested a new set of assets
 * from the network. However, some of these requests were served from the HTTP cache. As a
 * result, Playground would start loading a mix of old and new assets and quickly error out.
 * What made it worse is that this broken state was cached in CacheStorage, breaking Playground
 * for weeks until the cache was refreshed.
 *
 * See https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/pull/1822 for more details.
 *
 * ### CacheStorage in the service worker
 *
 * Playground primarily relies on the **Cache only** strategy. This means assets are:
 *
 * 1. Loaded from the network without using any HTTP caching.
 * 2. Stored in the CacheStorage.
 * 3. Served from the CacheStorage on subsequent requests.
 *
 * While this strategy enables fast load times and an offline experience, it also
 * creates a substantial challenge.
 *
 * When a new Playground version is deployed, all the clients will load an old
 * version of the `remote.html` file on their next visit. Unfortunately, that old
 * `remote.html` file contains hardcoded references to assets that may not be
 * cached and are no longer exist in the new webapp build.
 *
 * To solve this problem, we use the **Network only** strategy when `remote.html`
 * is requested. This introduces a small network overhead, but it guarantees loading
 * the most recent version of `remote.html` and all the referenced assets.
 *
 * There's still a small window of time between loading the remote.html file and
 * fetching the new assets, when a new deployment would break the application.
 * This should be very rare, but when it happens we provide an error message asking
 * the user to reload the page.
 *
 * ### Edge Cache on playground.wordpress.net
 *
 * The remote server (playground.wordpress.net) has an Edge Cache that's populated with
 * all static assets on every webapp deployment. All the assets served by playground.wordpress.net
 * at any point in time come from the same build and are consistent with each other. The
 * deployment process is atomic-ish so the server should never expose a mix of old and new
 * assets.
 *
 * However, what if a new webapp version is deployed right when someone downloaded 10 out of
 * 27 static assets required to boot Playground?
 *
 * Right now, they'd end up in an undefined state and likely see an error. Then, on a page refresh,
 * they'd pick up a new service worker that would purge the stale assets and boot the new webapp
 * version.
 *
 * This is not a big problem for now, but it's also not the best user experience. This can be
 * eventually solved with push notifications. A new deployment would notify all the active
 * clients to upgrade and pick up the new assets.

/**
 * Forces the browser to always use the latest service worker.
 *
 * Each service worker build contains a hardcoded `buildVersion` used to derive a cache key
 * for offline-mode-cache. As long as the previous service worker is used, it will
 * keep serving a stale version of Playground assets, e.g. `/index.html`, `php.wasm`, etc.
 *
 * This is problematic for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. Users won't receive critical bugfixes for up to 24 hours after they're released [1].
 * 2. Users will experience fatal crashes. Assets such as the WebAssembly PHP builds are
 *    loaded asynchronously using fetch() and import() functions. The specific URLs are
 *    hardcoded by the bundler at build time, e.g. the worker-thread.js file contains
 *    a call similar to `import("./assets/php_8_3-2286e20c.js")`. If the browser uses
 *    a stale version of the worker thread, it will try to import a JavaScript file
 *    that no longer exists.

 * Pair the site editor's nested iframe to the Service Worker.
 *
 * Without the patch below, the site editor initiates network requests that
 * aren't routed through the service worker. That's a known browser issue:
 *
 * * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=880768
 * * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1293277
 * * https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/765
 *
 * The problem with iframes using srcDoc and src="about:blank" as they
 * fail to inherit the root site's service worker.
 *
 * Gutenberg loads the site editor using <iframe srcDoc="<!doctype html">
 * to force the standards mode and not the quirks mode:
 *
 * https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38855
 *
 * This commit patches the site editor to achieve the same result via
 * <iframe src="/doctype.html"> and a doctype.html file containing just
 * `<!doctype html>`. This allows the iframe to inherit the service worker
 * and correctly load all the css, js, fonts, images, and other assets.
 *
 * Ideally this issue would be fixed directly in Gutenberg and the patch
 * below would be removed.
 *
 * See https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/42 for more details
 *
 * ## Why does this code live in the service worker?
 *
 * There's many ways to install the Gutenberg plugin:
 *
 * * Install plugin step
 * * Import a site
 * * Install Gutenberg from the plugin directory
 * * Upload a Gutenberg zip
 *
 * It's too difficult to patch Gutenberg in all these cases, so we
 * blanket-patch all the scripts requested over the network whose names seem to
 * indicate they're related to the Gutenberg plugin.
