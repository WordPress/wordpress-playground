/**
 * Playground's service worker. Here's a rundown of non-obvious things that
 * are happening in here:
 *
 * ## Playground must be upgraded as early as possible after a new release
 *
 * New service workers call .skipWaiting(), immediately claim all the clients
 * that were controlled by the previous service worker, and forcibly refreshes
 * them.
 *
 * Why?
 *
 * Because Playground fetches new resources asynchronously and on demand. However,
 * deploying a new webapp version of the app destroys the resources referenced in
 * the previous webapp version. Therefore, we can't allow the previous version
 * to run when a new version becomes available.
 *
 * ### Push notifications
 *
 * It would be supremely useful to proactively notify the webapp after a fresh deployment.
 * Playground doesn't do that yet but it likely will in the future.
 *
 * ## Caching strategy
 *
 * Playground relies on the **Cache only** strategy. It loads assets from
 * the network, caches them, and serves them from the cache. The assumption
 * is that all network requests yield the most recent version of the remote file.
 *
 * This helps us avoid the HTTP cache problem.
 *
 * ### Cache layers
 *
 * We're dealing with the following cache layers:
 *
 * * HTTP cache in the browser
 * * CacheStorage in the service worker
 * * Edge Cache on playground.wordpress.net
 *
 * ### HTTP cache in the browser
 *
 * This service worker skips the browser HTTP cache for all network requests. This is because
 * the HTTP cache caused a particularly nasty problem in Playground deployments.
 *
 * Installing a new service worker purged the CacheStorage and requested a new set of assets
 * from the network. However, some of these requests were served from the HTTP cache. As a
 * result, Playground would start loading a mix of old and new assets and quickly error out.
 * What made it worse is that this broken state was cached in CacheStorage, breaking Playground
 * for weeks until the cache was refreshed.
 *
 * See https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/pull/1822 for more details.
 *
 * ### CacheStorage in the service worker
 *
 * This servive worker uses a **Cache only** strategy to ensure all the loaded assets
 * come from the same webapp build.
 *
 * The **Cache only** strategy means Playground only loads each assets from
 * the network once, caches it, and serves it from the cache from that point on.
 *
 * The only times Playground reaches to the network are:
 *
 * * Before the service worker is installed.
 * * When the service worker is being activated.
 * * On CacheStorage cache miss occurs.
 *
 * ### Edge Cache on playground.wordpress.net
 *
 * The remote server (playground.wordpress.net) has an Edge Cache that's populated with
 * all static assets on every webapp deployment. All the assets served by playground.wordpress.net
 * at any point in time come from the same build and are consistent with each other. The
 * deployment process is atomic-ish so the server should never expose a mix of old and new
 * assets.
 *
 * However, what if a new webapp version is deployed right when someone downloaded 10 out of
 * 27 static assets required to boot Playground?
 *
 * Right now, they'd end up in an undefined state and likely see an error. Then, on a page refresh,
 * they'd pick up a new service worker that would purge the stale assets and boot the new webapp
 * version.
 *
 * This is not a big problem for now, but it's also not the best user experience. This can be
 * eventually solved with push notifications. A new deployment would notify all the active
 * clients to upgrade and pick up the new assets.

 * Forces the browser to always use the latest service worker.
 *
 * Each service worker build contains a hardcoded `buildVersion` used to derive a cache key
 * for offline-mode-cache. As long as the previous service worker is used, it will
 * keep serving a stale version of Playground assets, e.g. `/index.html`, `php.wasm`, etc.
 *
 * This is problematic for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. Users won't receive critical bugfixes for up to 24 hours after they're released [1].
 * 2. Users will experience fatal crashes. Assets such as the WebAssembly PHP builds are
 *    loaded asynchronously using fetch() and import() functions. The specific URLs are
 *    hardcoded by the bundler at build time, e.g. the worker-thread.js file contains
 *    a call similar to `import("./assets/php_8_3-2286e20c.js")`. If the browser uses
 *    a stale version of the worker thread, it will try to import a JavaScript file
 *    that no longer exists.

/**
 * Ensures:

 * * The very first Playground load is controlled by this service worker.
 * * Other browser tabs are upgraded to the latest service worker.
 *
 * ## Initial load
 *
 * This is necessary because service workers don't control any pages loaded
 * before they are activated. This includes the page that actually registers
 * the service worker. You need to reload it before
 * `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` is set and the fetch() requests are
 * intercepted here.
 *
 * However, the initial Playground load already downloads a few large assets,
 * like a 12MB wordpress-static.zip file. We need to cache them these requests.
 * Otherwise they'll be fetched again on the next page load.
 *
 * client.claim() only affects pages loaded before the initial servie worker
 * registration. It shouldn't have unwanted side effects in our case. All these
 * pages would get controlled eventually anyway.
 *
 * ## Upgrading other browser tabs
 *
 * This activation hook upgrades all the Playground browser tabs to the latest
 * service worker version, and that service worker upgrades them the latest version
 * of the webapp.
 *
 * The moment a new Playground version is deployed, the existing browser tabs
 * won't be able to load assets from the network. The older Playground version
 * they're running contains hardcoded URLs to assets that no longer exist on
 * the server.
 *

 * Pair the site editor's nested iframe to the Service Worker.
 *
 * Without the patch below, the site editor initiates network requests that
 * aren't routed through the service worker. That's a known browser issue:
 *
 * * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=880768
 * * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1293277
 * * https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/765
 *
 * The problem with iframes using srcDoc and src="about:blank" as they
 * fail to inherit the root site's service worker.
 *
 * Gutenberg loads the site editor using <iframe srcDoc="<!doctype html">
 * to force the standards mode and not the quirks mode:
 *
 * https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38855
 *
 * This commit patches the site editor to achieve the same result via
 * <iframe src="/doctype.html"> and a doctype.html file containing just
 * `<!doctype html>`. This allows the iframe to inherit the service worker
 * and correctly load all the css, js, fonts, images, and other assets.
 *
 * Ideally this issue would be fixed directly in Gutenberg and the patch
 * below would be removed.
 *
 * See https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/42 for more details
 *
 * ## Why does this code live in the service worker?
 *
 * There's many ways to install the Gutenberg plugin:
 *
 * * Install plugin step
 * * Import a site
 * * Install Gutenberg from the plugin directory
 * * Upload a Gutenberg zip
 *
 * It's too difficult to patch Gutenberg in all these cases, so we
 * blanket-patch all the scripts requested over the network whose names seem to
 * indicate they're related to the Gutenberg plugin.
