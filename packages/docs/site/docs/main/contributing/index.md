## A note on contributing and the GPL license

Playground and the WordPress project are strongly rooted in free and open source software. Specifically, Playground is licenced under GPLv2 (or later) from the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/). You can [read the text of the license here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

As such, please be aware of the implications your contributions will fall under:

-   When you contribute, your contributions are licensed under GPL
-   The GPL license has strong copyleft provisions that ensure all derivative works remain open-source and under the same license terms, thereby promoting a collaborative development environment.
-   The GPL license encourages contributing any changes, bug fixes, or new features back to the original codebase.
-   The GPL license ensures that the project remains free and open-source, not only in terms of cost but also with respect to the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.

If you have any questions about how the above might effect your contributions, please feel free to reach out on WP Slack and the [`meta-playground` channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04EWKGDJ0K).
