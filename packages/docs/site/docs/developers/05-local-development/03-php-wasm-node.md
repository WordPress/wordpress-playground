# Using WordPress Playground in Node.js

As a WebAssembly project, you can also use WordPress Playground in Node.js.

If you need low-level control over the underlying WebAssembly PHP build, take a look at the [`@php-wasm/node` package](https://npmjs.org/@php-wasm/node) which ships the PHP WebAssembly runtime. This package is at the core of all WordPress Playground tools for Node.js.
