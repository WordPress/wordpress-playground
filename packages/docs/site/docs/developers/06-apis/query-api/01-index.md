# Query API

WordPress Playground exposes a simple API that you can use to configure the Playground in the browser.

It works by passing configuration options as query parameters to the Playground URL. For example, to install the pendant theme, you would use the following URL:

```text
https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant
```

You can go ahead and try it out. The Playground will automatically install the theme and log you in as an admin. You may even embed this URL in your website using an `<iframe>` tag:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant"></iframe>
```

| `language`             | `en_US`               | Sets the locale for the WordPress instance. This must be used in combination with `networking=yes` otherwise WordPress won't be able to download translations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

For example, the following code embeds a Playground with a preinstalled Gutenberg plugin and opens the post editor:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=gutenberg&url=/wp-admin/post-new.php&mode=seamless"> </iframe>
```

## GitHub Export Options

The following additional query parameters may be used to pre-configure the GitHub export form:
