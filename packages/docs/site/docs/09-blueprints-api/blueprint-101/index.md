# Blueprints 101

Welcome to a Blueprints crash course, where you'll find everything you need to know about Blueprints: what they are, how to create them, and how to use them effectively.

1. [What are Blueprints, and what can you do with them?](./what-are-blueprints-what-you-can-do-with-them.md)
2. [How to load and run Blueprints](./how-to-load-run-blueprints.md)
3. [Build your first Blueprint](./build-your-first-blueprint.md)

> [!NOTE]
>
> ## Blueprints version 2
>
> The team is exploring ways to transition Blueprints from a TypeScript library to a PHP library. This would allow people to run Blueprints in any WordPress environments: Playground, a hosted site, or a local setup.
>
> The proposed [new specification](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints-library/issues/6) is discussed on a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints-library/), and you’re more than welcome to join (there or on the [#meta-playground](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04EWKGDJ0K) Slack channel) and help shape the next generation of Playground.
