# Start Contributing

WordPress Playground is an open-source project and welcomes all contributors from code to design, and from documentation to triage. Don't worry, you don't need to know WebAssembly to contribute!

## How can I contribute?

-   Code? See the [developer section](./02-code.md).
-   Documentation? See the [documentation section](./20-documentation.md).
-   Reporting bugs? Open an [issue](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/new) in the repository.
-   Triage – see the [triage section](./05-triage.md).
-   Ideas, designs or anything else? Open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/discussions) and let's talk!

## Guidelines

-   As with all WordPress projects, we want to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone. With that in mind, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/).
-   Contributors should review the [coding standards](./03-coding-standards.md).
-   You maintain copyright over any contribution you make. By submitting a pull request you agree to release that code under [WordPress Playground License](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/HEAD/LICENSE).
