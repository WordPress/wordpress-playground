/**
 * These tests pin down the trap behind
 * https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/3783.
 *
 * The Playground CLI handed a spawned PHP worker its parent's file lock manager
 * *proxy* where a MessagePort was expected. Comlink serialized the proxy onto a
 * port backed by an asynchronous `expose()`, and `consumeAPISync()` accepted it
 * without complaint — because a Comlink proxy answers every property access
 * with a proxied function, so it duck-types as an endpoint.
 *
 * The child therefore appeared to boot correctly and only failed on the first
 * synchronous call, five seconds later, on another thread. `consumeAPISync()`
 * must reject the bad endpoint at the point of the mistake instead.
